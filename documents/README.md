# documents
Home to shrendd documentation.

## Examples and Tutorial Guides
This is the home for defined examples and tutorial guides.
More will be added overtime, but this is a good place to get started with shrendd.

Each folder under `documents/[examples|tutorials]` should be treated as an independent "project". This means treat each `documents/[examples|tutorials]/<folder>`
as the root directory for that given example.

Some folders are specifically examples. Fully defined and functional and ready to run `shrendd`. These will be under the "documentation/examples" directory.
Others are written in a tutorial style with a step-by-step howto guide to develop the templates, either from the ground up
or from an initial starting point. These will be under the "documents/tutorials" directory.

### Recommended Tutorial Order
1. quickstart
2. libraryImport
3. extractTemplate

## Help
[wiki](https://github.com/gtque/shrendd/wiki) will be the home for the help files as they are written.
The help will cover the different shrendd parameters, modes/actions, and properties in detail. The help information will link to an example or tutorial as appropriate and available.
